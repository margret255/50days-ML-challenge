# Day 5: Loan Status Prediction

## Description
This project focuses on predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not using machine learning classification models.  
It’s part of my **50 Days of ML** challenge.

## Dataset
- Contains applicant details like gender, marital status, income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

## Objectives
- Explore and clean the dataset
- Handle missing values via imputation
- Encode categorical features using label encoding
- Split data with stratification
- Train and compare models (Logistic Regression and SVM)
- Evaluate with accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Files
- loan_status_prediction.ipynb — main notebook
- README.md — this file

## Learnings
- Difference between imputation and label encoding
- Why we use `stratify=y` during train-test split
- How `hue` helps visualize categories in Seaborn
- Practical comparison between Logistic Regression and SVM
- Model evaluation techniques for classification
