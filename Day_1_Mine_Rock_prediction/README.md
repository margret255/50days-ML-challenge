# Day 1: Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification using Logistic Regression 

## ðŸ§¾Description
This project focuses on classifying whether an object detected by sonar is a **rock** or a **mine** using Logistic Regression.  
It kicks off my **50 Days of Machine Learning** challenge.

##  Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))
- Features: 60 continuous variables representing sonar signal reflections
- Target:  
  - `R` for Rock  
  - `M` for Mine

## Objectives
- Load and explore the sonar dataset
- Encode categorical target labels
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##  Files
- `sonar_logistic_regression.ipynb` â€” main notebook
- `README.md` â€” this file


##  Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, LabelEncoder, train_test_split, metrics)
- matplotlib & seaborn (for visualizations)


## âœ… Learnings
- Refreshed understanding of logistic regression
- Practiced data preprocessing and label encoding
- Learned how logistic regression handles binary classification
- Noted the limitations of linear models on certain datasets
