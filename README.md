# 50 Days of Machine Learning 🚀

Welcome to my 50-day machine learning challenge!  
I'm committing to learning and building one ML project or concept each day for 50 days straight.

## 📅 Challenge Overview
- Goal: Solidify my understanding of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning
-  Tools: Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
- Datasets: From Kaggle, sklearn, and other open sources

## 📁 Project List
| Day | Project_Folder |
|-----|---------|--------|
| 1   | Mine Rock Prediction (Logistic Regression)|
| 2   | Diabetes_prediction (Support Vector Machine)
| 23  | Boston_House Prediction (XGBoost)



##  Lessons I'm Learning
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Real-world deployment (eventually )

Let’s gooo!
