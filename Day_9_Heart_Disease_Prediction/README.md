✅ Day 8: Heart Disease Prediction
📘 Description

This project focuses on predicting whether a person has heart disease or not using Logistic Regression.
It is part of my ongoing 50 Days of Machine Learning challenge.
📊 Dataset

    Contains patient health data such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, etc.

🎯 Objectives

    Load and explore the dataset

    Preprocess features (cleaning and encoding)

    Split the data into training and testing sets

    Train a Logistic Regression model

    Evaluate the model's performance

    Interpret predictions and understand model accuracy

📚 Learnings

    Logistic Regression is ideal for binary classification tasks

    The use of stratify=y ensures balanced class distribution in both training and test sets

    Understood the difference between evaluating on training vs. testing data

    Learnt how to compute and interpret:

        Accuracy score

        Confusion matrix

        Classification report

    Practiced splitting datasets in a way that avoids model bias

    Reinforced the importance of cleaning and preprocessing medical datasets
